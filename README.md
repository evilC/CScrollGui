# CScrollGui
A Class that enables scrollbars for GUIs. Same as Just Me's code, but using _Struct / WinStructs

This code is the same as Just Me's code from [here](http://ahkscript.org/boards/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=6316&p=37529#p37529), just using _Struct / WinStructs to remove bitwise ops and improve readability.
